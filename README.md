# stock-analysis
Deliverable 2

Background: Steve’s parents are looking to purchase stock from DQ. They are wondering about the activity of the stock that was actively traded in 2018. Finding was that in 2018 there was a -63% return on stock Daqo. 

Purpose: The purpose of this was to help Steve and his parents create a workbook to determine the best stock to invest in. Steve needed help analyzing some stock data. He wants to find the total daily volume and yearly return for each stock along with the yearly return of the stock from the beginning of the year to the end. 

Results:
Stock Performance: With the selected stocks that Steve and his parents were interested in, there were only 2 that were successful 2 years in a row. After having huge increases of 100% or more in 2017, stocks DQ, FSLR, and SEDG were all negative for 2018. This could mean that the company made changes or that the company was not as desirable as it was in 2017. 

Execution time
Summary: Before making any moves into the stock market, Steve and his parents might want to look into some of the companies more. Most of the stocks that they were analyzing were very volatile from 2017 to 2018. The yearly return, the percentage difference in price from beginning of the year to the end of the year, shows a decrease in most of the stock. This could mean that the stock would be a risk to invest in at this point in time.
